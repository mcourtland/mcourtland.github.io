                                    examine how the language people expose themselves to affects the language they are
                                    comfortable using. To do this, I collect a language sample comprising all the media
                                    people report consuming. I then use language models (statistical and machine
                                    learning, all in Python) to capture regularities present in these samples. With
                                    these models, I evaluate possible language material for predicted bias, in order to
                                    choose the best items for people. This helps to ensure people from diverse language
                                    backgrounds are comfortable with the language we use.</p>

                                    representations of words (word embeddings - Word2Vec) in different languages. Using
                                    the same classifier for a sentiment analysis task, my team used features generated
                                    from word embeddings of different languages. These languages differed in
                                    morphological complexity (i.e. amount of information per word), which influenced the
                                    effectiveness of the word embeddings.</p>

                                <p>I use MATLAB to create noise with the same frequency (spectral) properties as speech.
                                    For this, I generate filters (fit with high-order LPC) to shape white noise. I then
                                    process this new noise to have special temporal (envelope) characteristics. By
                                    combining this noise with processed speech samples, I generate auditory stimuli with
                                    specific acoustic properties.</p>
                                <p>I then used functional MRI to image people's brains while they listened to these
                                    stimuli. These MRI signals represent brain activity over time and require signal
                                    processing to denoise, identify activation trends and relationships, and examine
                                    whether (and where) activation is caused by the stimuli.</p>

                                    simulate emotion), and a Computational Auditory Scene Analysis system to separate
                                    speech from background noise using Deep Learning.</p>

                                    <p>Clinical tests use standardized language in an effort to make tests fair. Making
                                        the
                                        language the same, however, does not account for the fact that people's language
                                        experiences are different. This diversity in language backgrounds leads to
                                        differences in test difficulty exactly because the language stays the same.</p>
                                    <p>My team recently found that people's performance is significantly different on
                                        these
                                        tests based on which popular media they consume. We found this variability to be
                                        unrelated to traditionally considered dimensions of variability (race, class,
                                        etc.).
                                        This may indicate that people's media exposure can influence the language they
                                        feel
                                        comfortable with.</p>
                                    <p>When we trained neural language models on the language the media sources
                                        contained,
                                        the models significantly correlated with people's performance. This implies that
                                        there are linguistic properties of media that can predict the test performance
                                        of
                                        people who consume it.</p>

                                    <p>While noise is often sporadic, many noises have recurring well-behaved structure
                                        (like a train engine or ticking clock). I study the ability of the auditory
                                        system
                                        to learn this regular temporal structure. Being able to identify this structure
                                        can
                                        allow people to predict and therefore overcome it, allowing us to hear signals
                                        amidst the noise. This incredible process happens constantly, but is only
                                        noticed in
                                        extremely challenging situations such as loud bars or concerts. To study this, I
                                        mostly use behavioral hearing tests, but have also used functional MRI
                                        neuroimaging.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>My initial findings showed that people were less hindered by the noise when it
                                        was
                                        regular, rather than sporadic. Our follow up experiments showed that this
                                        process is
                                        not as straight-forward as we anticipated. It seems that certain people can gain
                                        a
                                        benefit from the repetition, but others are actually hampered by it. We are
                                        currently investigating what teases these two populations apart. So far, we have
                                        ruled out general cognitive ability (working memory, executive function) and
                                        musical
                                        experience.</p>

                                        properties of
                                        speech production.</p>

                                    <p>In my undergraduate work, I used acoustic phonetic analysis to document dying
                                        languages. I built online "talking dictionaries" that contained sound recordings
                                        of
                                        words produced by the last native speakers of these languages. To create
                                        dictionary
                                        entries, I used phonetic analysis (in praat) to transcribe how the words were
                                        pronounced. My transcriptions, while useful, were no substitute for the nuanced
                                        speech patterns of actual native speakers, so the dictionaries include both. I
                                        then
                                        wrote my undergraduate thesis on a new combination of sounds present in one of
                                        these

                                    <p>In the early years of my PhD, I studied the post-operative speech outcome of
                                        tongue
                                        cancer patients. To do this, I used real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging of
                                        patients' vocal tracts while speaking, before and after surgery. After
                                        performing
                                        image processing on the videos of patients' speech, I modeled their articulatory
                                        behavior to draw meaningful inferences on whether (and how) their speech motor
                                        behavior changed post-operatively.</p>
